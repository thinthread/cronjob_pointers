cronjob_pointers

This repository aims to give a few hints on how to read,
write and navigate the process of creating cronjobs.

For Mac os, cronjobs are implemented via crontab.

Crontab = cronological table
	  
It is a method by which one can impliment automaiton,
such as for a script, utalizing system built in features, as in 
the terminal and for Mac VIM; although opting to use another 
text editor such as Nona is possible and simple.

Claim: As I learn more about the fine atributes of cronjobs
       and how best to implement aspects of crontab, I will
       note them to the files as well as this README in this 
       repository.
